# Fractals


Software is designed and implemented that would plot two of the most
popular fractals: Mandelbrot set and Julia set.
Fractals are infinity many, self-similar shapes formed by some simple mathematical computations. The computation varies from fractal set to set but are generally based on complex numbers.
Java multi threading is used for this.
